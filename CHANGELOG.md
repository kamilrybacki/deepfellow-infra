# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/).

## [Unreleased]

### Fixed
- Reconfiguring OTLP log export via `/admin/config` no longer blocks the API for up to ~30s when the OTLP collector is unreachable, and a failed reconfigure no longer permanently disables further log-export retries.

## [0.33.0] - 2026-09-11

### Added
- MCP server health checks and OAuth token refresh now emit OpenTelemetry metrics (`mcp.healthcheck.count`, `mcp.healthcheck.duration` in ms, `mcp.oauth.refresh.count`) and spans, for observability into MCP integration failures. Enabled by the existing `otel_tracing_enabled` flag — no separate metrics flag.
- Adding a custom vLLM model by HuggingFace id now checks upfront whether the repo can actually be served (GGUF/quantized repos, LLM repos without a usable chat template, and reranker repos with an unsupported architecture), returning a clear error immediately instead of only failing later when the model's container tries to start.
- vLLM, llama.cpp, and SGLang catalogs can now be refreshed at runtime instead of only via the offline `just get-vllm-models`/`just get-llamacpp-models`/`just get-sglang-models` release recipes: an admin can trigger `POST /admin/services/{service_id}/catalog/refresh` (or the model list's "Refresh catalog" WebUI action) to re-crawl HuggingFace for the current top trending/downloaded/liked models and reload the service's default model list, without a redeploy. Runtime refresh is only available when `static/` is writable; it shares a single in-flight HuggingFace rate-limit budget across all three services, and refuses to write a catalog that shrank suspiciously compared to the one it would replace.

### Changed
- Default `standard_proxy_timeout_seconds`/`DF_STANDARD_PROXY_TIMEOUT_SECONDS` is now 600 seconds instead of 300, matching the default used by the OpenAI/Azure SDKs and LiteLLM, so long-running chat completions and other proxied responses aren't cut off prematurely.

### Fixed
- Setting or changing the Civitai, Hugging Face, or adapter registry token via `PUT /admin/config` (or the WebUI settings page) now takes effect immediately for model downloads. Previously the token was persisted correctly but downloads kept using the value captured at process startup until the backend was restarted.
- A custom endpoint (e.g. a document-processing service) installed only on a child node in a node-mesh now works correctly when accessed through a parent node's proxy. Previously the parent forwarded the request to the child with the model's prefix stripped from the URL, so the child could never route it and the request always failed — even though the mesh connection itself was healthy.
- An installed MCP server whose container only works over one transport (e.g. SSE) while DeepFellow had registered it on the other (streamable HTTP, the default) no longer silently returns empty tools/results. The periodic healthcheck already detected the working transport as a fallback probe, but only updated the transport shown in the UI — the live proxy stayed pointed at the broken one. It now re-registers the live proxy on the transport it actually found working.
- Cancelling a docker-compose-based install no longer leaves the underlying `docker compose` subprocess (and any container it already created) running orphaned in the background. `Utils.run_command` now kills the subprocess and waits for it to exit when the task awaiting it is cancelled, matching the pattern `DockerService.build_image` already used — this affects every command run through it, not just `docker compose`.
- Cancelling or otherwise failing an MCP model install after its Docker container has started now tears that container down and removes the in-progress install bookkeeping, matching the rollback already in place for vLLM, SGLang, and llama.cpp model installs. Previously MCP left both the container and the bookkeeping behind.
- A model install that adopts a pre-existing container and then fails at a later step (registration, capacity detection, etc.) no longer tears down that adopted container on rollback. The previous fix to make stop/restart/uninstall act on compose-file-less adopted containers (directly above) had the side effect of making install rollback destroy an adopted container too, since it now looked no different from an intentionally-installed compose-file-less service; rollback now only tears down what the failed install attempt itself created.
- Stopping, restarting, or uninstalling a service whose container was adopted rather than freshly installed (see the adopted-container fix in `0.32.0` below) now actually acts on that container instead of silently doing nothing or failing, since these operations no longer assume a compose file always exists.
- A service instance's "already installing" guard could be bypassed by a concurrent second install/update request: right after the guard check passed, the tracking field was reset to `None` for the entire duration of the slow pre-promise setup work, so a request arriving in that window slipped past the guard and clobbered the first install's tracking state. Affected 6 of 9 backing services (Ollama, llama.cpp, vLLM, SGLang, Coqui, Speaches AI) whose setup does real Docker image/registry checks before anything else. The same window also made the service-install progress endpoint spuriously 404 and made service listings report the instance as neither installed nor installing. The tracking object now has a two-phase lifecycle: reserved immediately (before any slow work begins) and resolved once the real promise exists. The install-progress endpoint now returns a `504` instead of hanging indefinitely if that pre-promise setup work is itself stuck.
- Editing a catalog model's install-time options (e.g. `gpu_memory_utilization`) or an installed custom model's definition, for services like vLLM whose model type carries no `default_prefix` (unlike MCP/Custom models), no longer crashes with a 500 `AttributeError`.
- Reranker/embedding registries (`static/vllm-min.json`, `static/sglang-min.json`) are no longer discovered by name search alone (`search=rerank`/`search=embed`), which missed any real reranker or embedding model whose repo name didn't spell out that word — e.g. `BAAI/bge-m3`, `intfloat/multilingual-e5-large`, `cross-encoder/ms-marco-MiniLM-L6-v2`. Candidates are now also discovered via HuggingFace's `pipeline_tag`, kept alongside the old name search; candidates found this way are filtered to exclude cross-encoders trained for a different task than reranking (e.g. `cross-encoder/stsb-*`, `cross-encoder/qnli-*`, `cross-encoder/quora-*`), which share the same architecture and tag as real rerankers but return meaningless rankings if served as one. A candidate whose HF detail lookup ultimately fails is now dropped instead of kept with fabricated data (`size: "N/A"`, incorrect `is_generative: true`). `just get-sglang-models` is also fixed — it always failed with `ModuleNotFoundError`.
- Retrying a model install while the original install is still running (e.g. after the client disconnects and reconnects) no longer reports instant fake success: the retry now waits for and reflects the real outcome of the in-progress install instead of a fabricated "already installing" response.
- Cancelling a service instance install/update (once a cancel path exists) would only have stopped a thin post-install bookkeeping wrapper, not the real work `_install_instance()` started (e.g. a `docker compose up` still in progress) — the reservation tracked the chained post-install promise instead of the real, unchained one, and cancellation only cascades down a chain, never up it. `InstallingInstance` now tracks both the real promise and the chained one separately, mirroring `InstallingModel`.

## [0.32.0] - 2026-09-01

### Added
- New `just refresh-generated-model-lists` recipe refreshes the four generated model registries (ollama, vLLM, llama.cpp, SGLang) in one run, in the style of `just check`. The five hand-curated lists in `static/` are deliberately left alone.
- Custom models added to vLLM and SGLang can now target a specific HuggingFace revision (branch, tag, or commit SHA) instead of only the repository's default branch.
- New `just get-llamacpp-models` recipe generates `static/llamacpp-min.json`, a registry of GGUF models discovered on HuggingFace for the llama.cpp backend, mirroring the existing `get-vllm-models`/`get-ollama-models` tooling. Every quant a repo ships is listed as a separate entry (not just one picked tier); multimodal projector files, split (multi-part) GGUF shards, multi-component pipeline files, non-chat repos (image/video diffusion, TTS, ASR, OCR), and embedding-only repos (including the `bge-`/`gte-`/`e5-` family prefixes, not just repos with "embed" in the name) are excluded since llama.cpp can't serve them as standalone chat models.
- New **Warnings** page in the WebUI (and `GET`/`DELETE /admin/warnings` API) surfaces failures that used to be visible only in the server logs: a service or model that fails to load, or a service present in `config.json` but no longer recognized in this build (e.g. after a downgrade), is now recorded as a dismissible warning. Warnings persist across restarts and are automatically cleared once the service or model successfully (re)loads, so they don't need to be manually dismissed once resolved.
- The sidebar's **Warnings** entry now shows a badge with the current warning count, so an unresolved failure is visible without opening the page.
- A service instance that fails to install or update is now also recorded as a warning, matching the existing behavior for a model that fails to install.
- New `just get-llamacpp-models` recipe generates `static/llamacpp-min.json`, a registry of GGUF models discovered on HuggingFace for the llama.cpp backend, mirroring the existing `get-vllm-models`/`get-ollama-models` tooling. Every quant a repo ships is listed as a separate entry (not just one picked tier); multimodal projector files, split (multi-part) GGUF shards, multi-component pipeline files, non-chat repos (image/video diffusion, TTS, ASR, OCR), and embedding-only repos (including the `bge-`/`gte-`/`e5-` family prefixes, not just repos with "embed" in the name) are excluded since llama.cpp can't serve them as standalone chat models.
- Claude and Google (Gemini) services can now refresh their model catalog from the provider's live model listing, matching existing OpenAI/Ollama behavior.
- Custom models added to vLLM and SGLang can now target a specific HuggingFace revision (branch, tag, or commit SHA) instead of only the repository's default branch.
- A subinfra connected to the mesh can now see and route to its parent's (and further ancestors') models, not just the other way around — both when it first connects and live as those models change — gated by a new `share_models_downstream` config option (on by default).
- A service instance that fails to install or update is now also recorded as a warning, matching the existing behavior for a model that fails to install.
- Installed MCP and custom services can now be edited in place via a new "Edit Settings" action, without manually uninstalling first — the backend transparently uninstalls, applies the new settings, and reinstalls. This also closes two previous edit gaps: catalog MCP models (e.g. `open-websearch`) can now have their prefix/envs/headers edited, and plain docker-image MCP servers (not `user`/`proxy` kind) can now be edited at all.
- Added a "Duplicate" option to the Edit dialog for MCP and custom service models, letting an admin create an independent copy of a model's settings under a new id and prefix for side-by-side comparison, without affecting the original.
- New `standard_proxy_timeout_seconds`/`DF_STANDARD_PROXY_TIMEOUT_SECONDS` setting (default 300) controls the timeout for outbound proxy HTTP requests to backend model/tool services, previously hardcoded to aiohttp's unconfigurable 300-second default. It's used as a total-duration cap for chat completions, embeddings, audio, images, rerank, and MCP proxying, and as a per-chunk idle-read window (no total cap) for custom-service proxying (doc-chunker, GLiNER, etc.). Live-editable via `/admin/config` and the WebUI settings page, not just `.env`.
- GLiNER named-entity-recognition is now installable as a custom service (CPU/GPU), exposed at `/custom/{prefix}/extract_entities` for knowledge-graph entity extraction.
- Built-in custom-service and MCP models (doc-chunker, bge-m3, lemmatizer, finetune, open-websearch, brave-search, etc.) now offer a Docker image version selector in their install form, letting an admin pick a specific tag instead of always getting the pinned default. Also fixes tag listing for images hosted on `hub.simplito.com`, which previously fell through to the wrong (Docker Hub) API.
- Custom-service installs can now set their own proxy read timeout via a new `proxy_timeout_seconds` field on the install form, overriding the global `standard_proxy_timeout_seconds` default for that specific service.
- New `webui2/` directory installs the DeepFellow Dashboard as an alternative web UI, as a proof of concept. `webui/` still builds the UI the image serves, and nothing about the default image content changes: the `Dockerfile` gained a `UI_VARIANT` build argument that defaults to `legacy`, and `DOCKER_BUILDKIT=1 docker build --build-arg UI_VARIANT=dashboard --secret id=gitlab_npm_token,src=<a file holding a registry token> .` selects the Dashboard instead. BuildKit is required for both builds now. New `just ui2-rebuild`, `just ui2-clean`, `just ui2-check-ignores`, `just ui-restore` and `just dashboard` recipes drive it. A `build_dashboard_variant_image` CI job builds the Dashboard variant on every pipeline and reads what came out of it, and a `check_dashboard_ui_ignores` job verifies that `.gitignore` still covers every file name that build emits. Both drop themselves while the `GITLAB_NPM_TOKEN` CI/CD variable is unset. See `webui2/README.md`, and `webui2/MIGRATION.md` for what adopting it would take.

### Changed
- The doc-chunker custom service install form now matches the reworked doc-chunker: image description and audio transcription share a single "inference gateway" address and optional API key instead of separate URL/key/model fields for each, new **LibreOffice conversion timeout** and **parallel image descriptions** settings were added, and the picture-description mode selector along with the preset/local HuggingFace options (and the HuggingFace token field) were removed since the service no longer supports them. Services installed with the old form keep their old settings until reinstalled or edited.
- `.gitignore` and `.dockerignore` now also list the file names the DeepFellow Dashboard build emits, beside the ones the legacy web UI emits, so neither UI's output can be committed or reach a build context by accident. Everything else under `static/` stays tracked, exactly as before.
- Model request routing now prefers already-warm, higher-capacity instances and packs traffic onto the fewest of them before spilling over, instead of always spreading load evenly across every registered instance regardless of how much concurrent load each can actually take.
- Model registries for llama.cpp, Coqui, rerank, Speaches, and Stable Diffusion are now loaded from `static/*-min.json` files instead of hardcoded in the service code
- Previously installed models keep working after the maintained registry list is refreshed or pruned.
- llama.cpp's default model list now loads from `static/llamacpp-min.json` at startup instead of being hardcoded in source, matching how vLLM and Ollama already manage their default model lists.
- vLLM service's hardware-support guard and GPU-utilization release logic are each backed by a single shared implementation instead of duplicated copies, removing the risk of the copies drifting apart on future changes.
- `.gitignore` and `.dockerignore` now also list the file names the DeepFellow Dashboard build emits, beside the ones the legacy web UI emits, so neither UI's output can be committed or reach a build context by accident. Everything else under `static/` stays tracked, exactly as before.
- Model request routing now prefers already-warm, higher-capacity instances and packs traffic onto the fewest of them before spilling over, instead of always spreading load evenly across every registered instance regardless of how much concurrent load each can actually take.
- SGLang instances now report their KV-cache-sized `max_running_requests` from startup logs as routing capacity, same as vLLM, so capacity- and warmth-aware routing packs traffic onto them instead of treating them as unbounded.
- Ollama's "Maximum parallel requests" field default in the WebUI is now `1` instead of `3`, matching the actual fallback (`OLLAMA_NUM_PARALLEL` unset defaults to 1) - a newly created Ollama instance that doesn't override this field now gets `OLLAMA_NUM_PARALLEL=1` instead of `3`.
- Warmth-aware routing now correctly tracks a backend's loaded/evicted model state from right after instance install, treats a backend with no reported concurrency number as unknown capacity (ranked last, never counted as saturated) rather than unbounded, treats Ollama's `OLLAMA_NUM_PARALLEL=0` ("auto") as bounded at DeepFellow's configured `OLLAMA_NUM_PARALLEL` default (conservatively `1`, not Ollama's own real auto-scaling behavior of up to 4 concurrent requests depending on available VRAM) rather than zero capacity, no longer registers a freshly-installed Ollama model as warm before it has actually loaded, no longer downgrades a mesh peer's genuinely unbounded backend (e.g. a cloud/proxy model with no concurrency cap) to "unknown capacity" on receipt, rejects a llama.cpp instance's invalid `num_parallel` (0 or negative) at both setup and update time instead of failing later during model registration and leaving an orphaned Docker container behind, no longer orphans a llama.cpp model's Docker container when a failure occurs between starting it and registering it, and no longer lets a misconfigured `OLLAMA_NUM_PARALLEL=0` in DeepFellow's own environment (as opposed to a per-instance override, which was already handled) silently fail every Ollama model install on that instance.

### Fixed
- `GET /v1/models` now reports `props.context_window` and `props.max_context_window` as `null` for a model whose registrations declare no context window, instead of `0`. Consumers use these as a ceiling for their own request sizing, and a reported `0` made them size against an impossible window — it broke DeepFellow Server's vector store chunking outright.
- `deepfellow-bge-m3` now declares its 8192-token context window.
- A zero or negative context window arriving from gguf metadata, a model directory's `config.json`, remote-model admin fields or Ollama form fields is now treated as "unknown" rather than published as a real window.
- Custom-service proxy requests (doc-chunker and other custom services, plus the mesh and Stable Diffusion custom-endpoint proxies) no longer have their total request duration capped at a flat 5 minutes; a backend that streams partial output now resets a per-chunk 5-minute window each time it sends data (15 minutes for doc-chunker and other custom services), so a slow-but-still-responding backend is no longer cut off just for taking a long time overall.
- Chat completions requesting JSON mode via `response_format={"type": "json_object"}` (without an explicit `json_schema`) are no longer rejected with a 422 error.
- vLLM service now logs a debug message when it can't resolve a custom model's size or can't determine its VRAM usage from container logs, instead of silently returning `None`.
- vLLM model install no longer silently swallows a failed Docker container stop during cleanup — the failure is now logged so an orphaned container can be found and removed.
- vLLM model installation no longer gets stuck permanently in "installing" state if the request is cancelled during a graceful shutdown while GPU/quantization checks are still running.
- vLLM's KV-cache-overflow retry logic no longer intercepts unrelated Docker startup failures; only the specific "estimated maximum model length" error now triggers a retry with an adjusted `--max-model-len`.
- Uninstalling an Ollama model (without purging) now unloads it from VRAM; previously it kept occupying VRAM until the whole Ollama container was restarted.
- Persisted model definitions no longer get wiped when a model drops out of the live registry (e.g. after a catalog refresh): the config snapshot now falls back to the last-persisted definition instead of overwriting it with `null`.
- Backfilling missing `definition` fields into `config.json` on startup no longer drops a model that failed to come up on that boot (transient error): the regenerated config now preserves that model's last-persisted entry instead of omitting it, so it keeps getting retried on future loads.
- A model definition snapshot from an older schema no longer aborts loading the rest of an instance's models: restoring it is now covered by the same error handling as the model install itself.
- A model that fails to (re)load is no longer permanently dropped from `config.json` the next time any unrelated action (installing another model, uninstalling a model, editing a custom model, etc.) triggers a config save — it stays persisted so it keeps getting a retry on every future load, until it's explicitly uninstalled.
- Refreshing the Ollama catalog no longer makes an already-installed model disappear from `list_models`/`get_model` at runtime when it has dropped out of the static and dynamic catalog: the persisted definition is now re-applied after the catalog rebuild, matching the existing restore-on-load behavior.
- Fixed the Ollama install progress bar getting stuck at 100% forever when a service install's post-processing step (e.g. saving config) failed after an install/uninstall/reinstall cycle.
- Rotating `infra_api_key` no longer leaves already-connected subinfras calling ancestor-proxied models with the old key: a proxy registration is now refreshed whenever the reporting peer's API key changes, not only when the model id itself is new.
- Fixed a `pyright` type-check failure on `main` caused by Docker Model Runner's `_generate_instance_config` override not matching its base class signature.
- Installing a service no longer fails outright when a Docker container with the same name already exists as an orphaned leftover from a previous, no-longer-tracked Infra instance (e.g. after wiping local state without running `infra uninstall`): if the leftover container is confidently the same healthy service (matching image, health, port, env vars, and volumes), it's adopted instead of blocking the install. An adopted vLLM/SGLang model, which has no persisted capacity to reuse (that prior instance's state is gone) and isn't actually restarted during adoption, now falls back to reading its still-running container's startup logs to recover the real concurrency capacity instead of leaving it permanently unknown.
- A HuggingFace model download with an invalid or unreachable repository id no longer silently reports install success with an empty model directory; it now fails fast with a "model repository not found" error instead of a confusing container-startup failure minutes later.
- Installing a rerank model on a rootful Docker setup no longer fails with `PermissionError`: the HuggingFace cache directory bind-mounted into the rerank container is now created by the server before the container starts (previously the Docker daemon created it as `root:root`, so the host-side model download couldn't write into it), and the container itself now runs as the server's user instead of root, so it no longer leaves root-owned files in that shared cache.
- `POST /v1/rerank` no longer returns 500 now that the rerank container runs as the server's user. The container's HuggingFace cache moved from `/root/.cache/huggingface` (unreachable for a non-root user, since `/root` is only traversable by root) to `/mnt/hf`, set via `HF_HOME`, and `USER` is now set in the container because torch's inductor cache derives its path from `getpass.getuser()`, which raised `KeyError: getpwuid(): uid not found` for a uid with no `/etc/passwd` entry in the image. The failure surfaced only at model-load time, so the container's healthcheck kept reporting healthy while every rerank request failed.
- Docker image builds now honor the `exclude-newer` dependency-resolution pin again. The build stage pinned uv 0.8.12, which cannot parse the `"1 week"` duration syntax in `[tool.uv]`, so it warned "Failed to parse pyproject.toml during settings discovery" and silently ignored the entire table — including the `required-version` floor meant to catch this exact mismatch. The pin is now uv 0.11.8, matching the version the lint and test jobs already use.
- A custom-service model could occasionally start two concurrent install attempts if requested twice in close succession; the model is now marked as installing before its Docker image is verified, closing that window.

## [0.31.0] - 2026-08-06

### Added
- New `POST /admin/mcp/convert-config` endpoint converts a standard MCP client JSON config (`{"mcpServers": {...}}`) into DeepFellow's custom-model parameters, so the CLI and other clients can reuse the same conversion the WebUI's "Auto-Import" tab already performed client-side.
- New `just get-vllm-models` recipe generates `static/vllm-min.json`, a curated registry of top HuggingFace LLM, reranker, and embedding models for the vLLM backend, mirroring the existing `get-ollama-models` tooling. Retries with backoff when the HuggingFace API rate-limits requests. Reranker candidates are filtered to models with a `*ForSequenceClassification` architecture, the only kind vLLM can serve as a cross-encoder — models merely named "reranker" but built as generative or custom-ranking architectures (e.g. Qwen3-Reranker, jina-reranker-v3) are excluded since they fail to load in vLLM.
- Read-only smoke test suite (`tests/bruno/`) that checks availability, docs, reported version, the admin and OpenAI-compatible read endpoints, and auth rejections over real HTTP against a running instance. It runs after every deploy to dev (main, hotfix branches and release tags); on a release tag it is a blocking gate, so a tagged build that fails it is never published to GitHub. Run it locally with `tests/bruno/run-local.sh`.
- New `GET /info` endpoint, authorized with the server key (`DF_INFRA_API_KEY`), returns the running Infra version (`{"version": "..."}`) read from `pyproject.toml`.
- Ollama service now has a "↻ Refresh catalog" button that fetches trending models from the Ollama library and merges them into the model list as a dynamic overlay, so newly released models show up without waiting for an app update. Each click always fetches fresh results; the 6-hour cache only applies to callers that don't pass `force=true`.
- Ollama Cloud support with cached model list.
- Most infra settings (mesh connection, API keys, MCP session limits, OTEL tracing/logging, etc.) are now stored in `config.json` and can be changed from the Configuration page (or the `/admin/config` API) without restarting the server. Only bootstrap settings still require `.env` and a restart.
- Ollama, llama.cpp, and vLLM service install and edit dialogs now include a searchable **Docker image version** selector populated from the container registry, filtered by the selected hardware variant. Leave the field empty to use the default bundled version.
- New `GET /admin/services/{id}/docker-tags` API endpoint returns available Docker image tags for a service, with server-side caching (2 h TTL) and optional `?hardware=` filtering.
- Optional `DOCKER_HUB_TOKEN` environment variable for authenticated Docker Hub access to raise rate limits when fetching image tags.
- Model download progress is now logged server-side (every ~10%), covering both the generic model downloader (HuggingFace, Civitai, adapter registry, direct URLs) and Ollama's native `/api/pull`, so real download progress is visible in the console instead of only the UI.
- New Claude models: Opus 4.7, Opus 4.8, Sonnet 5 and Fable 5.
- New OpenAI models: GPT-5.4 Pro, GPT-5.5, GPT-5.5 Pro, and the GPT-5.6 family (Sol, Terra, Luna).
- New DeepSeek service (`deepseek-v4-flash`, `deepseek-v4-pro`).
- New Kimi service (`kimi-k2.6`, `kimi-k3`, `kimi-k2.7-code`, `kimi-k2.7-code-highspeed`).
- DeepSeek V4 (Flash, Pro) and Kimi (K2.6, K2.7 Code) added to the self-hosted vLLM model registry.
- New Google AI (Gemini) chat models: Gemini 3.6 Flash, Gemini 3.5 Flash, Gemini 3.5 Flash-Lite, Gemini 3.1 Flash-Lite, Gemini 3 Flash (preview), and Gemma 4 (26B-A4B, 31B).
- New Google AI embedding and image models: Gemini Embedding 2, the Nano Banana 2/2-Lite/Pro image models, and GA Imagen 4.0 Standard/Ultra.
- Remote (proxy) MCP servers now support OAuth 2.1 authorization (PKCE): DeepFellow auto-detects when a server requires OAuth, walks discovery/registration per the MCP Authorization spec, and exposes an "Authorize" action in the WebUI; tokens are refreshed automatically in the background.
- New SGLang service (modeled on the vLLM service) for serving LLM, embedding, and reranker models. Rerank responses are normalized from SGLang's native array shape into the Cohere-style `{"results": [...]}` shape the rest of the API expects.
- New Docker Model Runner service (modeled on the ollama-external proxy pattern) for serving LLMs via Docker Desktop's built-in Model Runner (`vllm` / `vllm-metal` backend), including GPU-accelerated inference on Apple Silicon via Metal without Ollama. Configurable base URL (default `http://localhost:12434`); models install from a curated built-in catalogue (`static/docker-model-runner-min.json`) and proxy chat/embeddings like other services. Requires Docker Desktop 4.40+ with Docker Model Runner enabled; the `vllm-metal` backend requires macOS on Apple Silicon.

### Changed
- Direct (non-dev) dependencies still in the `0.x` series are now pinned with `~=` instead of `>=` in `pyproject.toml`, so `uv lock` can only pick up patch-level updates for them, not minor bumps that may break compatibility.
- The project now licenses under the MIT License. Python files require an `SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT` header instead of the previous DeepFellow Free License copyright block; `just license-check --fix` migrates old headers automatically.
- `OllamaChatMessage.role` is now a free-form string instead of a `Literal`, matching Ollama's native API, which does not validate role names. Required by models that define their own role vocabulary — e.g. Granite Guardian 3.3 passes RAG documents as `document` (and `document <id>` for multiple documents) when checking groundedness and context relevance.
- Container healthcheck (`scripts/healthcheck.py`) now probes `/health` instead of `/docs`, consistent with every other health probe.
- Bumped bundled llama.cpp Docker image from `b9894` to `b10068` (latest published image build). Known risk: two upstream vulnerabilities remain unpatched as of this release — CVE-2026-2069 (GBNF grammar stack overflow) and an unpatched GGUF `general.alignment` integer overflow — both were already present in the previous `b9894` pin and are unrelated to this bump; mitigate by not accepting untrusted GGUF files or exposing GBNF grammar sampling to untrusted input until upstream ships a fix.
- Bumped bundled Ollama Docker image from `0.31.1` to `0.32.1` and vLLM from `v0.24.0` to `v0.25.1` to stay current with upstream releases. No known outstanding security advisories affected the previous pins.
- Bumped bundled open-websearch MCP Docker image from `v1.2.0` to `v2.1.9` to stay current with upstream releases.
- Ollama VRAM usage for loaded models is now read directly from Ollama's `/api/ps` response instead of being parsed from container logs.
- Python files under `ee/` now require an `SPDX-License-Identifier: LicenseRef-DeepFellow-Free` header instead of MIT; `just license-check` rejects a stray MIT header in `ee/`, and `--fix` migrates it automatically.
- Coqui TTS now runs from `idiap/coqui-ai-TTS`, an actively maintained community fork, instead of the original `coqui-ai/TTS` repo, which has had no upstream activity since August 2024. Also fixes the bundled CPU/GPU Docker images being swapped (the "CPU" option was pulling the GPU-capable image and vice versa).

### Fixed
- Custom model installation for SGLang and VLLM now correctly uses model's hf_id instead of model_id.
- speaches-ai model installs no longer fail with a `PermissionError` on a fresh install when running the backend as a non-root user (e.g. via `just dev`). The container now runs as the current host user instead of always as root, so the cache directory Docker creates on first start is writable by the backend.
- `POST /v1/embeddings` Request schema now also accepts token-array `input` and restricts `encoding_format` to `base64`/`float`.
- `/v1/responses` no longer fails a pyright type check by passing an unawaited coroutine as request headers.
- vLLM model install no longer fails outright when a model's default context length needs more KV cache than is actually free (e.g. `ValueError: ... estimated maximum model length is 110256`). If the user didn't request a specific `max_model_length`, install now retries once with the length vLLM itself suggests instead of leaving the model unusable.
- Infra not resolving `:latest` tags from /api/ps Ollama endpoint for VRAM calculations.
- `scripts/get_ollama_models.py` no longer captures raw scraped HTML markup as a model's `size` when the Ollama library page renders a "usage slot" widget instead of plain size text (seen for at least one cloud-hosted model, `gemini-3-flash-preview`); the captured text is now validated against a size-string pattern and discarded otherwise. Also corrected the already-affected entry in `static/ollama-min.json`.
- vLLM now detects when an already-installed model's Docker container stops running for good (crash, OOM, manual `docker stop`, hung process reported `unhealthy`) and releases its reserved GPU memory automatically, without requiring a backend restart. Previously the GPU-utilization counter stayed occupied forever for a dead container, blocking further model loads.
- llama.cpp now detects a crashed/killed model container (crash, OOM, `docker stop`, `unhealthy`) and releases its VRAM automatically, without a backend restart — matching the vLLM fix. Previously the model stayed reported as loaded, blocking further installs.
- `config.json` is now written to the storage directory instead of the app directory, so dynamic settings (mesh key, API keys, etc.) survive container recreation instead of resetting on every redeploy.
- OTEL trace/log exporter endpoint changes now take effect immediately instead of silently keeping the old endpoint until a restart.
- vLLM now releases reserved GPU memory and stops the model container on every model-install error path (option parsing, download, container start, post-start setup, and endpoint registration), not just on a Docker `RuntimeError`. Previously a failure after the container started left it running and kept the GPU-utilization budget occupied, blocking further model loads until a full service restart.
- VRAM estimation no longer crashes the entire model listing endpoint when a model (e.g. Qwen3.5, Gemma4) reports `null` for `num_key_value_heads` in its Ollama architecture metadata. Incomplete architecture metadata is now handled in the calculator itself: a missing or zero KV-head count falls back to standard MHA (`head_count_kv = head_count`, matching llama.cpp's own default) and a missing embedding length or layer count reports the estimate as unavailable, instead of raising a `TypeError` that surfaced as HTTP 500.
- VRAM estimates for models whose metadata omits `num_key_value_heads` are no longer understated. The previous fallback assumed a single KV head, which shrank the computed KV cache by the model's full GQA ratio (up to 32× for a 32-head model); the MHA fallback now reports the real cache size.
- llama.cpp models whose GGUF metadata omits `attention.head_count_kv` now get a VRAM estimate instead of none at all — the field is no longer treated as mandatory when parsing GGUF architecture parameters.
- The WebUI model list now shows an error message with a Retry button when the models endpoint fails, instead of silently rendering an empty "No models found" table that was indistinguishable from a service with no models. Failed VRAM estimates are also logged (at debug level) rather than being suppressed without a trace.
- A transient failure to reach Ollama's `/api/ps` no longer reports a still-loaded model as unloaded with a lower-fidelity VRAM estimate.
- Installing an MCP server without a required API key/header (e.g. brave-search without `BRAVE_API_KEY`, ollama-websearch without `OLLAMA_API_KEY`) no longer shows a fake download that runs to completion without installing anything. The missing field is now flagged inline in the install form before submit, and the backend rejects the request with a clear error listing the missing keys.
- The Cancel button for an in-progress model installation in the WebUI now appears in the model's table row, so it stays available after refreshing the page. Previously cancelling was only possible from the bottom progress toast, which disappeared on refresh and left the installation with no way to cancel.
- API errors now return an OpenAI-style `invalid_request_error` body with `message` and `param` identifying the offending field, instead of a bare `{"detail":"Bad Request"}` with no diagnostic detail.
- `/v1/models` now reports each model's real registration timestamp and owning service in `created`/`owned_by` instead of always `0`/`"unknown"`.
- `/v1/responses` now resolves `item_reference` inputs pointing at a stateful item (e.g. a reasoning item) this gateway emitted earlier in the conversation, instead of rejecting it (Ollama-backed models) or crashing with a 500 (OpenAI-backed models).
- `/v1/responses` no longer rejects function tools whose parameter schema has an optional (not-`required`) property — `strict` now defaults to `false` instead of `true`.
- `/v1/responses` no longer rejects `function_call`/`function_call_output` history items on the OpenAI-backed path: a duplicated `type` discriminator on `CustomToolCall` was colliding with `FunctionToolCall`'s, making the union ambiguous for every `function_call` item. `id`/`call_id` also no longer share one value generated once per process, so tool-call history replays byte-for-byte.
- `/v1/models?additional_data=true` now reports the correct endpoint list for Ollama, llama.cpp, and vLLM models; a malformed `LLM_ENDPOINTS` entry had merged two endpoint paths into one string and dropped the leading `/` used by every other endpoint.
- The vLLM and SGLang model registries (`just get-vllm-models` / `just get-sglang-models`) no longer omit every multimodal model. HuggingFace tags vision-language chat models as `image-text-to-text` rather than `text-generation`, so the scraper never even requested them, while community re-uploads of the same weights that happened to be tagged `text-generation` were present. Single-purpose OCR models pulled in by the new tag are excluded, since they are text extractors rather than chat models.
- The scraper's non-LLM name filter no longer discards valid models over a substring match: `ner` matched inside `ForConditionalGeneration` (every multimodal repo) and inside author names, so those models were dropped before any other check ran. Task words are now matched on word boundaries.

### Changed
- Stable Diffusion service to Stable Diffusion Next
- Chnage errors with Stable Diffusion to contain Stable Diffusion Next

## [0.30.0] - 2026-06-26

### Added
- MCP and custom service models now display a short description and an optional repository link below their name in the WebUI.
- All built-in MCP servers and custom services now have descriptions and repository URLs populated in their definitions.
- User-defined MCP servers (Command and Remote URL) support optional Description and Repository URL fields when added through the WebUI.

### Fixed

- Fixed VRAM estimation to use the correct bits-per-weight for each specific GGUF quantization variant (e.g. Q4_0 vs Q4_K_M) instead of a single per-model-family value, and applies a small per-family runtime-overhead multiplier (Q4 → ×1.02, Q8 → ×1.0, etc.) calibrated against real GPU measurements rather than guessed.

## [0.29.0] - 2026-06-19

### Added
- MCP servers now auto-detect their transport type (`streamable_http` or `sse`) and tool list on installation; they appear in the model list only after a successful health check.
- Toast notifications in the WebUI now have a close (X) button in the top-right corner, so pop-ups (e.g. installation messages) can be dismissed manually. In-progress download/install toasts keep their "Cancel" action and gain the X once they finish.
- All service types in the Infra WebUI now show a "↺ Refresh" button on their Models page; previously the button was only available for `ollama-external` services.
- Readable, read-only view of an installed service's configuration in the WebUI: a "Settings" button on each installed service opens a dialog showing every option with its proper field label (reusing the install-form spec metadata), with password fields masked and revealable via an eye icon. This replaces the raw key/value config dump previously shown inline in the services list.
- Installed services now show an **Edit** button alongside the Settings view, allowing in-place reconfiguration of a service without uninstalling it.
- Admin-only **Configuration** page in the WebUI: displays all infra environment variables with copy-to-clipboard buttons; secret values (API keys, tokens) are masked by default and revealed on demand via an eye icon; filled values sort to the top of the table.
- Cancel button for an in-progress model installation in the WebUI. Cancelling stops the underlying Docker image pull, tears down the whole install promise chain (no orphaned background tasks), closes the progress stream cleanly, and leaves the model uninstalled.
- MCP servers can now be registered from the Infra Web Panel in three ways: running a stdio-based server in Docker via a built-in bridge (Command), proxying a remote endpoint (Remote URL), or using a pre-built Docker image (Custom Image).
- Custom MCP proxy models (Remote URL) now support SSE transport in addition to the default Streamable HTTP — a `proxy_transport` field (`streamable_http` | `sse`) can be selected when installing a Remote URL MCP server.
- Added preferred default hardware when installing Service through UI.
- The **default model prefix** field in MCP server forms (Command and Remote URL) is now auto-proposed based on the server name/ID as the user types; the suggestion is overridden once the user manually edits the prefix field.

### Fixed

- Fixed models appearing twice in Infra UI Mesh when installed twice in a short timespan.
- Fixed inflated Ollama VRAM/RAM estimates for not-yet-loaded models: the estimate now uses the context Ollama actually runs with instead of the model's full native window.
- User-defined (Command/stdio) MCP servers now show their size in the WebUI instead of "N/A": it is resolved from the locally built Docker image on install and persisted so it survives restarts.
- Fixed the WebUI model-install progress percentage drifting out of sync between the table row and the bottom-right toast (most visible on slow connections): the toast now reads its `%` from the install-progress store (the same source as the row) instead of computing it from a raw value, so it respects the store's monotonicity rules and no longer freezes during the final completion animation.
- Installing a service/model whose Docker container name is already taken now fails with a clear `409 Conflict` ("A container named '<name>' already exists — remove it or choose a different name") instead of a generic "unknown error" that swallowed the underlying docker "is already in use by container" message.
- Fixed metrics password authentication always rejecting valid credentials by comparing a `SecretStr` object directly instead of calling `.get_secret_value()`.
- Fixed docker build subprocess not being killed on cancellation or exception during log streaming, leaving orphaned processes.
- Fixed `KeyError` crash when the install-progress error callback fired after the progress entry was already removed.
- Fixed MCP service teardown silently swallowing errors from model uninstall; errors are now logged.
- Fixed VLLM GPU memory utilization not being released when model installation is cancelled via `asyncio.CancelledError`.
- Installing a GPU-dependent service (e.g. Stable Diffusion Next) on a host without the NVIDIA container toolkit now surfaces a clear, actionable error instead of silently appearing to succeed and then failing health checks repeatedly.
- `push_to_github` release job no longer fails on a shallow clone; release tags are now verified to originate from `main`.
- CI no longer fails `pyright` non-deterministically on merge pipelines: the CI uv version is bumped to `0.11.8`, which understands the relative `exclude-newer` cooldown, so `uv.lock` is honored instead of being silently ignored and re-resolved. A `required-version = ">=0.11.8"` floor prevents an older uv from reintroducing the issue.
- Requesting a model that is not installed now returns `404 Model not found` instead of the misleading `400 Given model is not supported`. The `400` response is now reserved for the case where the model exists but does not support the requested endpoint (e.g. calling `/v1/embeddings` with a chat model).
- Remote service handling of models with aliases.
- Fixed MCP model types (`mcp`) being reported as untestable — the **Test** button now works for MCP servers and sends a `tools/list` request to validate the connection.
- Fixed DuckDuckGo MCP server (and other SSE-based Remote URL MCP servers) not working due to being hardcoded to Streamable HTTP transport.
- Fixed auto-import of MCP JSON config not detecting SSE transport when the server URL ends with `/sse`; also added a confirmation dialog before overwriting existing import.
- Fixed WebSocket client crash on mesh connect when services with custom endpoints are registered — `custom` was missing from the valid model type set.
- Model download errors during installation now return `504 Gateway Timeout` on network timeout and `507 Insufficient Storage` when disk space runs out, instead of a generic error; the installation progress stream now includes the actual error text in all cases.

### Changed
- New Python dependencies must be at least 1 week old (`exclude-newer = "1 week"` in `pyproject.toml`); new npm packages must be at least 7 days old (`min-release-age=7` in `.npmrc`) before they can be added to the project.

## [0.28.0] - 2026-06-03

### Changed
- Concurrent model uninstallation in all services.
- `openspec/specs` directory is now tracked in git so OpenSpec can read project specs between tasks

### Added
- Ollama External service models now report `context_window` and `max_context_window` in `GET /v1/models?additional_data=true`, populated from Ollama's `/api/show` endpoint.
- Added opt-in OTLP log export (`otel_logging_enabled = true`): Python application logs and uvicorn access/error logs are forwarded to the configured OTLP endpoint alongside traces.

### Fixed
- Removed "Required for OpenAI" flag for API_KEY when installing cloud service through Infra UI
- Improved error messages when pulling a HuggingFace model fails in Ollama and Ollama External: missing `hf.co/` prefix, non-GGUF repository, and gated model now show actionable messages instead of a generic "Model not available". Unknown errors now include the raw Ollama error text.
- Fixed GPU realtime stats raising an uncaught `OSError` when `nvidia-smi`/`rocm-smi` cannot be launched by the server process — a missing or non-launchable binary now correctly results in no GPU stats instead of an error.
- Fixed test result modal leaving the test running and stuck in "pending" when dismissed via Esc, backdrop click, or the X button — every dismissal method now cancels the in-flight test, same as the Cancel button.
- Fixed WebUI installation progress bar resetting to 0% when the page is reloaded mid-install.
- Fixed progress bar jumping backwards during active installation on each 10-second background refetch.
- Fixed progress bar regressing from 100% back to ~90% and replaying the completion animation a second time.
- Fixed orphaned `setInterval` timers when the polling effect and an active install mutation raced to track the same service/model.
- Fixed Ollama and Ollama External download progress overcounting bytes when multiple model layers are downloaded in parallel — per-digest tracking replaces the previous single `(last_digest, last_value)` pair.
- Added Vitest unit tests for `progress-simulation.ts` and `install-progress-store.ts` covering all regression scenarios.
- Added backend regression tests for Ollama per-digest progress tracking in `test_ollama_service.py` and `test_ollama_external_service.py`.
- Fixed command injection vulnerability in `Utils.run_command` — replaced `create_subprocess_shell` with `create_subprocess_exec` and changed the signature to `list[str]`, eliminating shell interpretation of subprocess arguments.
- Fixed model install falsely reporting success after a failed download: a stale download-progress entry could make a retry skip the actual download and leave the model "not installed". The entry is now always cleaned up on failure across all model services (llamacpp, ollama, ollama-external, rerank, speaches-ai, stable-diffusion, vllm).
- Added backend regression tests for download-progress cleanup on failure across all model services.

### Changed
- `check_key` is now a required field in the WebSocket `InitRequest`; subinfra nodes that omit it are rejected at parse time. The optional-field migration workaround has been removed.
- `healthcheck_start_period` in `SrvMcpCustomModel` and `SrvCustomCustomModel` now validates against `^\d+[smh]$` (e.g. `30s`, `5m`, `1h`), rejecting invalid Docker duration strings at parse time.

## [0.27.0] - 2026-05-27

### Added
- Actual VRAM/RAM usage.
- Estimated VRAM/RAM usage per model in ollama, llamacpp and vllm services.
- Infra mesh topology: each node connects to a single parent and learns the full ancestor chain up the graph.
- Propagation of topology changes via RPC `topology_update` (join/leave).
- Every node has knowledge about other nodes (upwards and downwards).
- New endpoint `GET /admin/mesh/topology` that returns the mesh topology tree from the current node's perspective.

### Changed
- Removed unused Pydantic models, orphaned config fields, dead functions, and stale commented-out code across multiple services.
- Replaced commented-out `print()` / `logger.info()` debug statements in `docker.py` and `core.py` with proper `logger.debug()` calls.
- Added `vulture` to dev dependencies for dead code detection.

### Fixed
- Fixed typo `uliumits` → `ulimits` in `DockerOptions` (`docker.py`).
- Fixed Stable Diffusion Next `n_iter` value defaulting to `None`/`0` when `body.n` is falsy — now correctly defaults to `1`.

## [0.26.3] - 26.05.2026

### Added
- Actual VRAM/RAM usage 
- Estimated VRAM/RAM usage per model in ollama, llamacpp and vllm services

### Fixed
- Fixed "Test" action for llama.cpp models in the admin UI — models with type `llm-v1-v2-v3-ant` were incorrectly reported as untestable.
- Download progress counter no longer jumps back during model installation.
- Removed broken PLLuM entries from `scripts/custom_models.json`: `tensorblock/Llama-PLLuM-8B-chat-GGUF` (account deleted, all URLs 404) and `CYFRAGOVPL/Llama-PLLuM-8B-chat` (modelfile error, cannot be installed). Refreshed `static/ollama-min.json` via `just ollama-get-models`.
