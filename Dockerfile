# Which web UI this image serves. `legacy` builds `webui/`, the UI this service has always shipped.
# `dashboard` builds `webui2/`, the DeepFellow Dashboard in single-instance mode. See webui2/README.md.
#
# The default keeps the legacy UI, and its image content is what it always was.
# BuildKit is now REQUIRED, including for the default build: the dashboard stage uses a secret mount, which the
# classic builder rejects, and the classic builder builds every stage. Docker 23 and newer use BuildKit by default.
# BuildKit builds only the stages the target depends on, so the stage this argument does NOT select never runs.
